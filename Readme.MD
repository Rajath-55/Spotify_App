# Spotify API App

## This app is an ongoing project of mine, that will eventually have recommendations based on user taste in playlists. 

Install all the requirements using the command : 
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make sure to have the Spotify API ready with the required credentials by creating a developers' account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/)
